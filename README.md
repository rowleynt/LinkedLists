## The Goal

The goal of this project is simply to implement a singly linked list in various programming languages with as close to identical functionality as each language allows.

## Criteria For "Fully Functional"

Each implementation is considered to be "fully functional" if it satisfies the following conditions:

[1] Able to append a node to the end of the list\
[2] Able to prepend a node to the front of the list\
[3] Able to insert a node into the nth position of the list\
[4] Able to remove the nth node from the list\
[5] Able to get the value of the nth node in the list\
[6] Able to get the length/size of the list\
[7] Able to output the list as a string or string equivalent\
[8] Able to iterate over a list using a language's loop function(s)*\

*This one can vary wildly in difficulty between languages and is mostly considered to be a "nice to have" feature rather than strictly required
